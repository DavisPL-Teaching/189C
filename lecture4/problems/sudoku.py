=== Sudoku ===

A Sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid of numbers, where each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all of the numbers from 1 to 9.

We are given as input a partially filled grid, where some of the cells
are empty (indicated by 0). Our goal is to fill in the empty cells
with the numbers from 1 to 9 to solve the puzzle.

=== Example input ===

[[5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
 [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
 [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
 [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
 [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]]

=== Example output ===

[[5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2],
 [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8],
 [1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7],
 [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3],
 [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
 [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
 [9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4],
 [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
 [3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9]]

Step 1

(*) Define a function that checks if a fully filled out Sudoku
board is valid

- Get input
- Solve function which actually solves the sudoku grid
    (*) used here?
- Print output

How to go about encoding a problem in Z3:
  1. What are the variables?
  2. What are the constraints?
  3. What are the properties we want to check?

1. Variables
Empty cells in the grid?
Column or row of each empty cell?
Boolean that says whether it's a valid solution

The
-> The 81 numbers in the grid
-> I have 81 integers in the grid.

2. What are the constraints?
1-9 in each column
1-9 in each row
1-9 in each box

(redundant)
The numbers themselves have to be between 1 and 9.

The integers that are given as part of the input
should stay the same.

(redundant)
No repeats within each row/column/box

* (This is more about the input -- let's start with the output)
Should the numbers also include 0?
-> We probably could do it that way
-> To simplify things let's start out by describing
what it means to be "valid Sudoku grid"
We'll see that the answer should sort of fall out of that.

Number of rows and columns should stay the same frmo input
to output.

Grid has to be 9 x 9

Notice that some of our constraints are redundant!
- we probably don't need all constraints at once.

3. What are the properties we want to check?

Yes/no answer
Is it a valid sudoku board?

Is the input grid solveable?

Day 10

Announcements:

- HW 2 is due in 9 days

- Mistake in HW2 part 3

Last time:

- We started working on a Sudoku solver using Z3

Plan for today:

- Clarify how solving problems with Z3 is different from normal programming

- Finish the Sudoku solver

- Task scheduler (2nd place with 24 votes)

- Any questions?

=== Clarification ===

Some people were confused last time!
Solving problems with Z3 is very different from the programming you are used to.

===== Solving problems without Z3 =====

Normal process: think about the input and output of the problem,
divide the problem into smaller parts, and solve each part.

How would we solve the Sudoku problem *without* Z3?

- Maintain the squares that are unknown (0s) and the squares
are known?

- Maintain a set of possible numbers for each square?

- If there's only one number possible, we could fill in
  that number.

- What if there are >= 2 numbers possible at every square?

  + If we don't care about doing it quickly, pick one?
    and then check if it works out!

  + If it doesn't work out, rollback the whole thing
    and pick the other.

Essentially: "try every combination"
Naive / "brute force" solution.

That doesn't sound very good!
- If we pick the wrong number, we could go down a long
path of trying things that don't work out.

Is there a better way?

===== Solving problems with Z3 =====

Z3 requires thinking about problems in a very different way!

Z3 process: think about "what" instead of "how":
    - we define the *output* as a set of abstract variables
    - we think about what constraints the output must satisfy
    - (Magic part)
      we pass the constraints to Z3 to solve the problem for us.

Z3 integers: not the same as Python integers!

(aside: quick terminal demo)

- In Z3, everything is an abstract expression
  Integer values are not known, they're abstract variables
  "x" and "y", not specific integers
- Z3 integers support +, *, ==, and some other operations,
  but don't assume that every Python operator is automatically
  going to work on Z3 integers.
- In Z3, everything proceeds in two stages: first, we create
  a Z3 expression or formula for what we want, and then
  we pass it to z3.solve or z3.prove to actually solve the
  problem.

Steps:
    1. What are the variables?
    2. What are the constraints?
    3. What are the properties we want to check?

(1) is talking about Z3 variables, not Python variables!
How are they different?
