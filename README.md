# ECS 189C: Software Correctness - Spring Quarter 2024

## Course Information

- **Instructor:** Caleb Stanford
- **TA:** Parnian Kamran
- **CRN:** 57484
- **Listed Title:** Special Topics in Computer Science - Programming Languages and Compilers
- **Schedule:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1:10-2pm
- **Location:** Teaching and Learning Complex 1218

## Course Description

What does it mean for software to be correct?

In this upper-level undergraduate course, we will explore the principles and practices behind building software that functions as its intended. Through a survey of topics, including model-based verifiers, program verification tools, and advanced type systems, students will gain hands-on experience with writing program models and program specifications using tools used in industry at companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

## Intended Audience and Prerequisites

This course is ideal for mid to upper-level undergraduate computer science majors.
While there are no official prerequisites, the following are unofficial requirements:

- A basic programming background (for example, the ability to write a program like [FizzBuzz](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fizzbuzz/problem)) will be expected. (ECS 36A/36B/36C)
- Some familiarity with discrete mathematics or mathematical proofs (e.g. ECS 20) will be helpful, but not required.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of software correctness and its importance.
2. Use random testing tools like Hypothesis for software testing.
3. Use model-based verifiers like Z3 for software analysis.
4. Apply program verification tools such as Dafny to ensure the correctness of software.
5. Explore advanced topics in software correctness, including advanced type systems and concurrency.

## Course Schedule

See `schedule.md`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Homeworks (50%):** 5 assignments (due bi-weekly), plus homework 0
- **Participation (10%):** via in-class quizzes and Piazza.
- **Final Exam (40%):** covering all topics covered in the course.

## Attendance

To encourage class attendance, there are in class polls that are worth a small amount of credit.
However, attendance is not strictly required;
I plan to make lectures available to join remotely on Zoom (starting from the second lecture), and they will also be recorded for later viewing -- please note that this is a best-effort process and I cannot promise that the lecture video quality will be perfect!
I also may not see/respond to questions and comments through Zoom.
If you are sick, to be considerate of your fellow students, please consider joining on Zoom.
If you miss class, there will be a way to make up the in-class quizzes
by watching the lectures and sending me your quiz responses
(I will announce how to submit this information later int he quarter).

## AI Policy

AI collaboration is allowed and encouraged for homework assignments. However, the final exam will be in-class and closed-book.
Please see also [Prof. Jason Lowe-Power's advice here](https://jlpteaching.github.io/comparch/syllabus/#using-generative-ai-tools).

## Collaboration policy

You may collaborate with each other on homeworks, if you do please list the names of your collaborators at the top of your submission.
However, each person must submit their own submission.

## Disclaimers

Communication from the instructor will only be sent through official UC Davis email addresses and channels. Please be vigilant of job scams impersonating faculty members. For more information, visit [UC Davis Job Scams Prevention](https://icc.ucdavis.edu/find/scams).

Please be nice to each other.
UC Davis has [policies against harassment and discrimination](https://hr.ucdavis.edu/departments/elr/preventing-discrimination-harassment).
Be inclusive of your teammates in group discussions.
If you need to, you may reach me by email to report an issue with a classmate or teammate.

## Contact and office hours

Please use the Piazza for questions related to course material.
I encourage you to ask anonymously if you feel more comfortable.
If you have a question that is more sensitive or unrelated to the course, please email me at (`cdstanford` `ucdavis` `edu`).

The instructor and TAs will be available during office hours for additional support on course material and assignments. The schedule will be announced during the first week of class.
