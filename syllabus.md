**Schedule:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1-2pm  
**Location:** [Building and Room Number]

## Course Description

What does it mean for software to be correct? In this upper-level undergraduate course, we explore the principles and practices behind ensuring software correctness. Through a survey of topics, including model-based verifiers, program verification tools, and advanced type systems, students will gain hands-on experience with tools used in industry at companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

## Intended Audience

This course is designed for upper-level undergraduates. A basic programming background (ability to write a program like FizzBuzz) and some familiarity with discrete mathematics or mathematical proofs are recommended.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience in any language.
- Some exposure to mathematical thinking (discrete math) or mathematical proofs is helpful but not required.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of software correctness and its importance.
2. Use model-based verifiers like Alloy and Z3 for software analysis.
3. Apply program verification tools such as Dafny to ensure the correctness of software.
4. Explore advanced topics in software correctness, including advanced type systems and concurrency.
