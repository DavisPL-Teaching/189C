# ECS 189C: Software Correctness - Spring Quarter 2024

## Course Information

- **Instructor:** Caleb Stanford
- **TA:** Parnian Kamran
- **CRN:** 57484
- **Listed Title:** Special Topics in Computer Science - Programming Languages and Compilers
- **Schedule:** Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1:10-2pm
- **Location:** Teaching and Learning Complex 1218

## Course Description

What does it mean for software to be correct?

In this upper-level undergraduate course, we will explore the principles and practices behind building software that functions as its intended. Through a survey of topics, including model-based verifiers, program verification tools, and advanced type systems, students will gain hands-on experience with writing program models and program specifications using tools used in industry at companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

## Intended Audience and Prerequisites

This course is ideal for mid to upper-level undergraduate computer science majors.
While there are no official prerequisites, the following are unofficial requirements:

- A basic programming background (for example, the ability to write a program like [FizzBuzz](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fizzbuzz/problem)) will be expected. (ECS 36A/36B/36C)
- Some familiarity with discrete mathematics or mathematical proofs (e.g. ECS 20) will be helpful, but not required.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of software correctness and its importance.
2. Use random testing tools like Hypothesis for software testing.
3. Use model-based verifiers like Z3 for software analysis.
4. Apply program verification tools such as Dafny to ensure the correctness of software.
5. Explore advanced topics in software correctness, including advanced type systems and concurrency.

## Course Schedule

See `schedule.md`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Homeworks (60%):** 5 assignments (due bi-weekly).
- **Participation (10%):** via in-class quizzes and Piazza.
- **Final Exam (30%):** covering all topics covered in the course.
