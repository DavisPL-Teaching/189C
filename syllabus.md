## Course Description

What does it mean for software to be correct?
How can we *know* that software will function as it is intended?

In this upper-level undergraduate course, we will explore the principles and practices behind building correct software. Through a survey of topics, including model-based verifiers, program verification tools, and advanced type systems, students will gain hands-on experience with tools used in industry at companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

## Unofficial Prerequisites

This is a special topics course; there are no official prerequisites.
This course is ideal for mid to upper-level undergraduate computer science majors. Specifically:

- A basic programming background (for example, the ability to write a program like [FizzBuzz](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fizzbuzz/problem)) will be expected. (ECS 36A/36B/36C)
- Some familiarity with discrete mathematics or mathematical proofs (e.g. ECS 20) will be helpful, but not required.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of software correctness and its importance.
2. Use model-based verifiers like Alloy and Z3 for software analysis.
3. Apply program verification tools such as Dafny to ensure the correctness of software.
4. Explore advanced topics in software correctness, including advanced type systems and concurrency.
