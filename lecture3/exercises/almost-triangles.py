"""
A triangle is an "almost right triangle" if one of its angles differs from
90 degrees by at most 15 degrees. A triangle is an "almost isosceles
triangle" if two of its angles differ from each other by at most 15
degrees.

1. Prove that all acute triangles are either almost right or almost
isosceles.

2. What happens if "at most 15" is replaced by "less than 15" in the problem statement?
