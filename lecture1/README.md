## Plans for lectures going forward:

- Most lectures going forward will be live coding

- The end of the class (~second half) will be an extended programming
exercise similar to what might be found on the homeworks

- I will be expanding the module on type systems / Rust (to about 2 weeks -- and will include 1 homework)

- Homework 1 will be released approx. Monday

- New plan for in-class polls using Google Forms

## Plan for today

(Overflow) Demos from last time explained in a bit more detail (~5 min)

1. Components of correctness: programs, specifications, and preconditions

2. Writing specifications

3. Types of specifications

4. Writing preconditions

5. Programming exercise: War implementation

(possibly for next time)
- Limitations and discussion

    - Specification is wrong

    - Specification is incomplete

    - Program model is wrong

    - Precondition is wrong

    - Mutability issues

    - Techniques for validating specifications

    - Important distinctions (terminology to be aware of)
        + Testing vs. verification
        + Static/dynamic
        + Soundness/completeness
        + White-box vs. black-box
