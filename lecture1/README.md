## Plan for today

1. Components of correctness: programs, specifications, and preconditions

2. Writing specifications

    - Fixing specifications

3. Types of specifications

3. Writing preconditions

4. Programming project: War implementation

(possibly for next time)
5. Limitations and discussion

    - Specification is wrong

    - Specification is incomplete

    - Program model is wrong

    - Precondition is wrong

    - Mutability issues

    - Techniques for validating specifications

    - Important distinctions (terminology to be aware of)
        + Testing vs. verification
        + Static/dynamic
        + Soundness/completeness
        + White-box vs. black-box
