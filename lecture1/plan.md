Components of correctness: programs, specifications, and preconditions

1. What is a program? (No, really)

2. What is a specification?

    - Types of specifications

    - What does it mean when a specification is wrong?

    - Techniques for validating specifications

    - Important distinctions:
        + Testing vs. verification
        + Static/dynamic
        + Soundness/completeness
        + Model vs. black-box

3. What are preconditions?

4. Programming project: rock-paper scissors
