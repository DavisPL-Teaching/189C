"""
Components of correctness: programs, specifications, and preconditions
"""

# 1. What is a program? (No, really)

# 2. What is a specification?

#     - Types of specifications

#     - What does it mean when a specification is wrong?

#     - Techniques for validating specifications

#     - Important distinctions:
#         + Testing vs. verification
#         + Static/dynamic
#         + Soundness/completeness
#         + Model vs. black-box

# 3. What are preconditions?

# 4. Programming project: rock-paper scissors
